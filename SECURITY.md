## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go to Issues and report your Vulnerability.

If your Issue is accepted, you will get an update within 1 week.
If your Issue is marked as .net problem, the problem will be maybe fixed with an .NET update if Microsoft will do.
See if there is a linked issue in the comments placed by me.
If your Issue is marked as Not Fixable, I will try to fix it, to consult help or go other ways, but I can not promise a fix.

Check your Issues for questions etc.
